These Code Smells can be addressed by applying refactoring techniques such as breaking down complex logic, simplifying conditionals, and improving code structure."
llama3.1:8b,pipes/data-table/src/lib/hooks/use-pipe-settings.tsx,27.28,2,2,0,0,0,0,0,"After analyzing the source code, I found the following Code Smell:

- **Smell Name:** Long Method
- **Location:** `usePipeSettings` function (entire function)
- **Explanation:** The `usePipeSettings` function is doing too many things: it's managing state, loading settings, subscribing to changes, and providing multiple functions. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle.
- **Refactoring:** Break down the `usePipeSettings` function into smaller, more focused functions, each with a single responsibility.

Additionally, I found another Code Smell:

- **Smell Name:** God Object
- **Location:** `usePipeSettings` function (entire function)
- **Explanation:** The `usePipeSettings` function is acting as a container for multiple unrelated functions (`updateSettings`, `getPreset`, etc.). This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes it harder to understand and maintain.
- **Refactoring:** Extract each of these functions into their own separate modules or functions, making them more focused and easier to understand.

Let me know if you'd like me to elaborate on these suggestions!"

Additionally, I found another Code Smell:

- **Smell Name:** God Object
- **Location:** `useSearchHistory` function (entire function)
- **Explanation:** The `useSearchHistory` function is returning an object with multiple unrelated properties and methods. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle.
- **Refactoring:** Extract a separate component or module for managing search history, and have it handle all related logic.

llama3.1:8b,pipes/data-table/src/lib/hooks/use-settings.tsx,51.61,4,2,1,0,1,0,0,"After analyzing the source code, I found several Code Smells:

**1. God Object: SettingsStore**
- Location: `SettingsStore` class
- Explanation: The `SettingsStore` class has multiple responsibilities, including storing settings, loading settings, updating settings, and notifying listeners. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle (SRP).
- Refactoring: Break down the `SettingsStore` class into smaller classes or modules, each responsible for a single task.

**2. Long Method: loadGlobalSettings**
- Location: `loadGlobalSettings` method in `SettingsStore`
- Explanation: The `loadGlobalSettings` method is too long and complex, performing multiple tasks such as loading settings, updating the store, and notifying listeners.
- Refactoring: Break down the `loadGlobalSettings` method into smaller methods, each responsible for a single task.

**3. Long Method: updatePipeSettings**
- Location: `updatePipeSettings` method in `SettingsStore`
- Explanation: The `updatePipeSettings` method is too long and complex, performing multiple tasks such as updating settings, updating the store, and notifying listeners.
- Refactoring: Break down the `updatePipeSettings` method into smaller methods, each responsible for a single task.

**4. Switch Statement with Many Cases**
- Location: `getPreset` method in `SettingsStore`
- Explanation: The `getPreset` method has multiple switch cases, which can be complex and hard to maintain.
- Refactoring: Use polymorphism or object-oriented principles to simplify the `getPreset` method.

**5. Duplicate Code**
- Location: Multiple methods in `SettingsStore` class
- Explanation: Some code is duplicated across multiple methods, such as error handling and logging.
- Refactoring: Extract common logic into separate methods or functions to avoid duplication.

llama3.1:8b,pipes/data-table/tailwind.config.ts,29.61,2,1,1,0,0,0,0,"After analyzing the source code, I found the following Code Smell:

- **Smell Name:** Long Method
- **Location:** The `theme` object has a large number of nested properties and values, making it difficult to read and understand.
- **Explanation:** This violates clean code principles because long methods (or in this case, objects) can be hard to maintain, debug, and modify. They often perform multiple unrelated tasks, leading to complexity and fragility.
- **Refactoring:** Break down the `theme` object into smaller, more focused objects or functions, each with a single responsibility.

Additionally, I found another Code Smell:

- **Smell Name:** Switch Statements
- **Location:** The `colors` property has multiple nested switch-like statements (e.g., `card`, `popover`, etc.).
- **Explanation:** This violates clean code principles because switch statements can become complex and hard to read when they have many cases.
- **Refactoring:** Use a more declarative approach, such as using an object with key-value pairs or a function that returns the desired color value.

- **Smell Name:** Long Method
- **Location:** `export async function POST(request: Request) { ... }`
- **Explanation:** This method is doing too many things: parsing JSON body, checking for errors, calling an external library (`browserPipe`), and handling exceptions. It's a good practice to break down complex methods into smaller, more manageable ones.

- Explanation: The `GET` function is too long and complex, performing multiple tasks such as input validation, parameter processing, error handling, and response formatting.
- Refactoring: Break down the `GET` function into smaller, more focused functions to improve maintainability and readability.

**2. Switch Statements with Many Cases:**
- Smell Name: **Switch Statements with Many Cases**
- Location: `if (!app)` block (not exactly a switch statement, but similar)
- Explanation: The code uses multiple `if` statements to check for boolean parameters, which can be replaced with a more concise and expressive approach.
- Refactoring: Consider using an object or a function to handle the boolean parameter conversions.

**3. Duplicate Code:**
- Smell Name: **Duplicate Code**
- Location: Error handling blocks (multiple occurrences)
- Explanation: The error handling code is duplicated in multiple places, which can lead to maintenance issues if changes are needed.
- Refactoring: Extract a separate function for error handling to avoid duplication.

**4. Complex Conditional Expressions:**
- Smell Name: **Complex Conditional Expressions**
- Location: `withTextOnly` and other boolean parameter conversions
- Explanation: The code uses complex conditional expressions to convert string parameters to booleans, which can be hard to read and understand.

- Refactoring: Replace magic numbers with named constants or enums.

**6. Long Variable Names:**
- Smell Name: **Long Variable Names**
- Location: `result` variable (not exactly long, but could be improved)
- Explanation: Some variable names are quite long and descriptive, which can make the code harder to read.
- Refactoring: Consider using more concise variable names while maintaining clarity.
